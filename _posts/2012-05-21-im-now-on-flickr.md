I have recently got into the world of photography, after the purchase of my first camera (FugiFilm Finepix S2950) I have taken to it like a duck to water. I had my first photo session recently spending an hour of a late Sunday evening walking the Lisburn Road in Belfast. Taking some photos of a mixed collection of buildings, wildlife and nature. This gave me a chance to get the camera out of the house and into a natural light environment allowing me to mix with different aperture, shutter and focus setting and to really get a feel for the limitations of the camera and my skill set. This then fulled the creation of a [Flickr][1] account o have a place that&#8217;s not Facebook to place my photos. so check it out and add any comments, i still have the meta data on all the photos for any camera setting questions.
