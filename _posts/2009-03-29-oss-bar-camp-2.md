Just back from the OSS Bar Camp. Dublin's only open source (as far as I know) event. Found out about the bar camp in the Dublin event guide (dublineventguide@gmail.com a guide to all the free events in Dublin vary good). The bar camp was on Saturday 9.30 to 4.30pm, it had a wide selection of talks all based around open source and ubuntu. The talks that I watched; the introduction (ubuntu community talk), GIT, MonoRail, being creative with free software and google. All very good talks I saw a video camera so will be keeping a eye for the video's. Would like to see what the talks where like. 

The talk on GIT, a open source solution to team foundation server or another source control software. I might try it out if I can find a project to start. MonoRail is a open source framework for web applications. I'm not mad about web application so didn't really love that talk but was presented very well and made me think about trying it. The being create with free software was OK, it was more or less a demo of VJ (video DJ) software created by the talker. And the google talk was for a current google employee and was very good. Had a lot of information about how google manages its server.

All in all it was a very good day, even got me to install ubuntu on my spare laptop (Toshiba portege M200) using wbui (www.wubi.com) a very easy to used program that you run on your windows machine. When you run this program you can select the drive and the space that ubuntu will take on you machine. Even created this post on the ubuntu install.
