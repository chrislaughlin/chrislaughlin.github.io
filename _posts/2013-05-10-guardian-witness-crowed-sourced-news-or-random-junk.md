Guardian Witness has been live now for almost a month and i thought it was time to have a review of it an how it has impacted the news we see. After signing up and downloading the applicable mobile app I was impressed by the look and fell of the whole experience , for a new platform it had a nice polished finish. However after a few minutes of scrolling through submissions which loaded extremely slow from both mobile and desktop I noticed that it was just a collection of mainly images some with captions and text (a lot looked like re posts from other sites) but with no real interaction from other users.

With a lack of user interaction some new worthy posts or &#8220;contributions&#8221; could be lost in the sea of junk, as we have learnt from almost all social media and crowed sourced sites the users must control the content. the introduction of comments/likes/up votes would improve the witness system as it would allow the most popular or interesting posts make it close to getting pushed into the real news. 

The posting process also needs to be reviewed as its biggest failing at the moment it that all posts must be approved by an admin what skills and qualifications they have gained God only knows. this results in a 9 to 5 web platform as I had tested when posting an image and not getting it approved until the next day. If this platform is going to give the people the chance to report the news it needs to be 24/7 as is the current main Guardian page. 

I think as a start the Witness platform could grow and improve but with other existing means of getting the latest news from the people such as twitter and Facebook do we really need something else that will be slow and probably be piggy backing of existing systems like twitter. Only time will tell.
