  Well its been a while but I have been busy working and playing, my latest venture is joining up with a group of Belfast artists to form the LOFT collective. This is a group of artists from a diverse background in many different disciplines, all with the same goal of taking art in Belfast to a new level and exposing there talents to a larger audience, to exchange idea&#8217;s, skills and most importantly make art fun and enjoyable for anyone.&nbsp; </p> <p>
    The group was founded by a group of friends who met through their passion for art and expression. Based in the picturesque LOFT Studio&#8217;s the group already regularly meet and exchange, with the new venture the group hopes to make a name for themselves in the Belfast art scene and hopefully try and change the way that art is seen in Belfast.
