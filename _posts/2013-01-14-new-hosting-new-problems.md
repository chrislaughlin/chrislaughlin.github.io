I recently decided to take the leap and move my hosting provider from [ipage][1] to the well recommended [DreamHost][2]. My reasons for moving centred around performance and features. Ipage was and is a cheap hosting solution for a personal site or a web design beginner, however when it comes to expanding and running multiple domains, web application platforms and servering a wide range of users it unfortunately fell short. Ipage does offer multiple domain management that is very easy to set up and use however it can be very slow at taking DNS setting which can be a pain if you need a site online in a day. Unlimited email account for each domain are also offered however one issue I found with this was once the account it created the user can not change the password. Only the web hosting account holder can do this making it hard to give out email addresses to users of a site and let them set a password. However the biggest draw back was the speed, for some not all domains the speed of the first visit was extremely slow to the point where I through that the site needed changes to speed it up.But with now images on page being server it should load fast.

DreamHost account created and on the two week trial which I find very nice for new customers who would like to try out everything, also the perfect solution for a one day pop up company. This is where the first problem showed once logged in I needed to transfer my domains but if i transfered the domains I wouldn&#8217;t be able to browse to the old site to extract the old word press data. This meant that I would have to set the domain to another free name I had then transfer the domain to DreamHost. The struggle then was to try and import the old word press this only worked for blog posts, i was unable to import pages. I asume the reason behind this was the amount of images on the pages as i was using them as a photography blog. I thought that this would have been a simple process. It has taken me almost a 4 hours to transfer this current word press instance and in the process I lost a large amount of data but this did give me the chance to clean the site up and change the flow from pages to posts.
