While recently reading through the random collection of EverNote notes I keep to remind me to read this install that, I came across a note relating to a JavaScript library called [underscore.string][1] this was developed by [Esa-Matti Suuronen][2] this was after he had looked online for something that could preform the different string tasks taken for granted in many other languages. After he was put into the direction of the underscore.js team he discovered that although a strong and feature rich library it still missed the string functions and that he would need to develop the code.

The standard JavaScript language holds a number of different function that can be used to process Strings these include:

*   accessing individual characters
*   accessing the String length
*   evaluation if a string matches a regx
*   slice the String
*   change to lower or upper case

However to Esa-Matti this was not enough there are 1000&#8217;s of different actions that can and need to be preformed on
 Strings in the web development world.
