    Over the past few days there has been a lot of talk on the net about the release of Google street view for the UK. I personal think the is wonderful having street view will help so many people in their day to day life. This about it you&#8217;re going to visit a friend in say London, and you have never been there before. He wants to meet at street in the centre of town, now the UK already has Google maps with satellite so you can zoom in far depending where your searching and see the rooftops &nbsp;this is a good help as you know which streets lead onto each other. But with street view you can actually walk down the street and see what&#8217;s on it (this is limited to streets with roads) this means you can see stuff like the nearest post box or shop on the street or even see if a area is wheel chair friendly. There has been a large amount of bashing &nbsp;against Google, saying that its invading people&#8217;s privacy and that it could be a tool used for crime or even for terrorists . This is just crazy talk Google have said many times and trust me every interview they do they mention this, all street view images can be taken down by request&nbsp; all images containing people will have their faces blurred out and any license plates on cars will be blurred out. This mean it could not be used for malicious purposes, images are not real time in most of the images shops such as Woolworths are still open *this shop closed in 2008. This means that the information that would be need by a terrorist would not be present. One thing that shocked me was an interview with the BBC tech new and a representative &nbsp;&nbsp;from Google in the UK, the reported discussed the issues with the Google representative and the reporter then asked &#8220;have you Googled your street&#8221; and the representative replied yes. To which the reporter said would you like someone looking at you street on Google street view then prompted the Google rep for his address, the Google representative gave his address down to the street name as he was under pressure. I feel this was wrong as you don&#8217;t need to be comfortable giving out your address over the internet just to prove that you&#8217;re in favor for Google Street view. You can support Street view but also not want to give out your address, not to the reason that people will look at your house but the fact people can send junk mail threats or other no internet related attacks. You don&#8217;t Google street view if you can to commit crime. <o:p></o:p>

    All in all I think Google street view is good and will help many people also can be&nbsp; fun way to pass time, and there have been already lots of images taken of funny stuff found and weird images of ghosts and UFO&#8217;s. <o:p></o:p>
