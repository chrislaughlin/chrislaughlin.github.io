So it&#8217;s the weekend after <a title="Qcon London 2014" href="http://qconlondon.com/" target="_blank">Qcon London 2014</a>, I&#8217;m still recovering from the intense talks, demos, coffee, alcohol and travel. The event spanned five days in the Westminster area of London. The first two days dedicated to training session (which I did not attend) and the remaining three days were dedicated to talks, demos, sharing sessions and idea exchanges.

## So day one:

I&#8217;m clearly holding back my excitement in the Image above. I had just checked in a was given my pass and a Qcon bag (not shown in the image). The next step was to head to the first talk &#8211; a presentation from <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2014/speaker/Damian+Conway" target="_blank">Damian Conway</a>. This was addressed to all attendees and was set to be a warm up for the rest of the week. The talk covered a number of topics including a walk through of a development language that uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon" target="_blank">Klingon</a> exclusively, which got a few laughs to say the least. This talk gave a strong positive track for the rest of the day and the week in fact. Below is a list of the talks that I attended on the first day. I will write up detailed posts on these over the next while.

Wednesday (Day One) provided an interesting mix of talks from processes, backend development and front end development.  I would say that the Etsy development and CI (Continuous Integration) , Project Avatar and Blade Runner JS talks were my favourite presentations of the day. The CI talk from Etsy really got me interested as in my current work project our CI process is extremely slow and cumbersome. In turn this is out of my control and the CI process is handled by the customer. I however feel that I can take on board some of the minor processes and the attitudes that were displayed by the Etsy development team. Project Avatar, being a Javascript project (and the first Javascript based talk of the day) meant that I was personally obliged to attend and I was not disappointed.  &#8220;Java and JavaScript working side by side&#8221;&#8230; Now other developers can see what I was ranting and raving about when I talked NodeJS up so much. Finally Blade Runner JS &#8211; with a name like that how could you not see the talk. The presentation demoed a really nicely designed JavaScript tool and a good concept in development. However it lacked the &#8220;wow factor&#8221; when I started to realise that with time and a little duct tape I could probably make the same tool myself.

To be continued&#8230;
