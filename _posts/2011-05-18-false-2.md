<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  So I have been working heavy with JavaScript in the recent months and in the last few days&nbsp; I decided that the project needed a isset function. This would be used to evaluate weather a variable had been set to an acceptable value e.g. not equal to undefined, null or an empty string (&#8220;&#8221;). This function has been working for the best part of a week until I ran into the scenario where a boolean was to be passed into the function however in this case as long as the boolean variable has been set be it true or false it still counts as being a set variable. However this destroys my code as it was checking if the variable was == &#8220;&#8221; which will mean that it returns that the variable is not see as I found out today that false evaluates to &#8220;&#8221;
