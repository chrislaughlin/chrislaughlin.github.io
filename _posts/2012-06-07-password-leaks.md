Well yesterday it was linked in and now reports are coming in that the next victim is last fm.  Yesterday linkedin released some tweets saying that passwords had been compromised and with the advice that everyone changes their passwords.  This will help put off the hackers however they still have the passwords and from what I can guess the email addresses of the accounts so they still have the ability to try and hack email accounts,  I have a two password system that is split between non important sites and important sites. Hopefully this will protect me against attack and also keep me away from using key chain software that will affect my logging into system when not on my personal machine.
