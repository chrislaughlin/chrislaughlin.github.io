Been thinking about putting a post together like this for a while and after seeing a tweet from another tech professional I decided to put together my own post listing the podcasts that I subscribe to.

## Programming

<a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/" target="_blank">JavaScript Jabber</a>

JavaScript Jabber is a weekly podcast that discusses font and backend JavaScript, coding best practices, coding environments and the JavaScript community. Hosted by <a href="http://devchat.tv/hosts/Joe%20Eames" target="_blank">Joe Eames</a>, <a href="http://devchat.tv/hosts/cmaxw" target="_blank">Charles Max Wood</a>, <a href="http://devchat.tv/hosts/jamison-dance" target="_blank">Aj O&#8217;Neal</a> and <a href="http://devchat.tv/hosts/jamison-dance" target="_blank">Jamison Dance</a> from <a href="http://devchat.tv/" target="_blank">DevChat.TV</a>, a must have podcast for any JavaScript developer. The guys have covered a very wide range of topics with regular guest from big name companies and communities from Angular and ember core developers to <a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich" target="_blank">Brendan Eich</a> (which was my favourite show to date). With years of experience in the professional JavaScript development world between them you are sure to hear about the latest and greatest tools and advancements in the JavaScript world. However if you are not a leet Javascript developer don&#8217;t be scarred as the guys are not afraid to ask what certain terms and patters are and get explanations for those who might not know.

### <a href="http://nodeup.com/" target="_blank">NodeUp</a>

In very simple terms NodeUp is a weekly podcast is a about Node.js, each week a different aspect of node is looked at usually with guests who are closely related to the topic and can provide a deep insight into the technology. With big name guests from the likes of Netflix, Socket IO developers and even the people behind NPM. This podcasts gives you a weekly insight into the world of node and what progression is going on inside and outside of the different communities that support and help Node grow. the podcast has also recently branched out to include an Australia segment that gives a voice to the quickly growing Node community growing in Australia and Asia. With hosts varying the most frequent hosts are <a href="http://twitter.com/dshaw" target="_blank">Dan Shaw</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/secoif" target="_blank">Tim Oxley</a>.

### <a href="http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/" target="_blank">Adventures in Angular</a>

Adventures in Angular is a dedicated Angular JS podcast forged by some of the hosts from JavaScript Jabber, I have only recently started to listen but I&#8217;m already blown way by the content and the tips and tricks that i have learnt. Running on the same format as JavaScript Jabber each week someone from the Angular JS world joins the hosts Joe Eames, Charles Max Wood and John Papa. What makes the podcast great is the focus on one part of Angular that gives you a look at what professional Angular developers think about parts of the framework and the workflows that they use. If you develop Angular for your profession or for fun this is a podcast for you, with the tips section at the end I have learnt or had my previous knowledge reinforced every time iv listened.

## Tech News

### <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/481" target="_blank">TWIT</a>

TWIT (This Week inTech) is a podcast that I have been following for years it is a weekly podcast hosted by the powerhouse podcaster [Leo Laporte][1]. It&#8217;s the flagship show of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="TWiT network" href="http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/TWiT_network">TWiT network</a>. It was the network&#8217;s first show, and it focuses on technology news, often from the prior week, and reviews. It is an audio podcast presented in a round-table fashion. In addition to host [Leo Laporte][2], who has appeared in nearly every episode, the show features a panel of usually two to five guests, which changes regularly. Some panelists appear more regularly than others. Covering all aspects of technology from smartphones, apps, hacks and memes you will be sure to get your weekly dose of tech. I find it hard at times to read tech news blogs daily to keep up with whats happening and trying to filtering out the junk. This podcast gives you whats important and some of the fluff for fun, with great personalities on each week you&#8217;ll be sure to listen or watch.

### <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/bottomline" target="_blank">The Bottom Line with Evan Davis</a> {#pc-keepnet-title}

Insight into business from the people at the top. Evan Davis meets influential business leaders for a round table conversation about the issues that matter to their companies and their customers. This is great podcast that has gave me some great party conversations from the episode with a sex toy company, a medical marijuana seller and a halal holiday booking firm. Always very interesting topics and even more interesting people.

Tim Harford investigates numbers in the news. Numbers are used in every area of public debate. But are they always reliable? Tim and the More or Less team try to make sense of the statistics which surround us. A half-hour programme broadcast at 1600 on Friday afternoons and repeated at 2000 on Sundays on Radio 4.

### <a href="http://www.scroobiuspip.co.uk/distraction-pieces-podcast/" target="_blank">Distraction Pieces Podcast</a> {#page-title}

In this weekly podcast <a href="http://www.scroobiuspip.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scroobius Pip</a> talks to various guests discussing many issues in a long form format, no trivial bite sized comments to be found, getting to the bottom of what matters. The first episode is with none other than Russell Brand, discussing capitalism, life and the universe! Upcoming podcasts will include Zane Lowe, Alan Moore & DJ Yoda. This is the latest podcast that I have started listing to, as a fan of Scroobius Pips music I was looking forward to hearing more from him and so far I have not been disappointed, I will be looking forward to hearing more from him.
