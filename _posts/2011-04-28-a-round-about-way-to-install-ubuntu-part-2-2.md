  So after all the hassle I am finally running a Ubuntu machine, actually blogging from it now which was the initial reason from fixing up the old laptop I had. In my last post I talked about merging the partitions to form the one big Ubuntu partition however this I have soon learn t cannot be done in my case, to change the main partition which I want to change it first has to be un-mounted. However the partition tool is located on the mounted partition, the solution for this is to use the Ubuntu live CD and use gpart. But if you have been following my story the machine doesn&#8217;t have a CD drive and can not boot from any other media. Thus leaving me in the position of having a main partition containing 31GB and then a second partition that must be mounted through the OS which contains 29GB. Not the ideal solution for me but none the less i have learn t some lessons: <ul>
    <li>
      Never buy a Toshiba Portege M200
    </li>
    <li>
      Always install Ubuntu on a machine with a CD drive
    </li>
    <li>
      The Ubuntu forums is a great place to find information 
    </li>
  </ul>
