Well Christmas has come a day is almost gone,  the new year approachs and it&#8217;s getting close to the time of reflection on the year. Strangely enough post more on this blog was one of my goals for the year and that hasn&#8217;t really worked out.  

The year has been interesting I have grown my skills and build a stronger presence on the Web,  many thanks to the recent work for a href=&#8221;http://loftbelfast.co.uk&#8221;LOFT studios/a. Focusing my work with word press has been interesting and I have learned more about the inner workings of a blog style cms. This solution seems be be applicable to all clients however not everyone wants to write a blog but with the pages that can be used in word press as seen in my photography section you can still deliver content without it being a blog.  

I hope to spend more time on the LOFT site and hopefully gather a strong user base but this requires content which can lack at time.  But with my amateur photography career kicking off with the recent acquisition of Canon 400D I shall be fighting to push the shutter speed group from LOFT into action.  Hopefully with weekly projects and maybe a show to exibit work this will drum up content.  I will also be taking photos of other art related events in Belfast and post a write up.
