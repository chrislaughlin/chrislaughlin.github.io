After the success of the LOFT drink and draw a LOFT member (Adam) and myself started our own spin off called Shutter Speed, this is a semi informal photography club for all skill ranges from beginner to advanced. The Shutter Speed idea developed from Adam and myself having a slight interest into photography but not having a friendly and easilyÂ  available means to learn and express through photography practice. We decided that we would hold Shutter Speed sessions on the same day as the LOFT&#8217;s drink and draw, this mean that we would be able to pull people together on a night that they would have already been in Belfast for. The first session seen the group walk through Belfast city center and together look for interesting building, objects, people and to achieve the goal of getting a great image. For the up and coming sessions the will be set themes for each session which will push people out of comfort zones to try and get the best image. Below are to post edited images from the first session more of my work for Shutter Speed and other camera sessions can be found on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrislaughlinphotos" target="_blank">Flickr page</a> Also you can check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/LOFT/219239428141582" target="_blank">loft Facebook</a>, to get involved in any of the drink and draw or Shutter Speed sessions like the page and leave a comment.
