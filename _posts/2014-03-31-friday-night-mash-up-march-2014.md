Over the weekend I attended <a href="http://www.fridaynightmashup.com/" target="_blank">Friday Night Mash Up</a> for the first time. Friday Night Mash Up is an even held in Belfast that promotes technology start ups and helps get exposer for different start ups based in or around Belfast. I had heard of the mash up event before but was unable to attend, however when I heard that the pub summit was co-hosting the event to make it an extra special night I made sure that I was free.

Iv known of the pub summit as it was held in Belfast last year and was topped to be a big event for technology in Northern Ireland. Now I would get a chance to take in both the Friday night Mash Up and the summit. The event was held in the iconic titanic pump house located on the outskirts of the Titanic quarter area of Belfast, already a hot spot of technology with the likes of Citi group.

Upon arriving at the event we were greeted with one of the Friday Night Mash Up reps giving out poker chips, the poker chip was for voting. The voting process involved each start-up have a bowl at the front of their &#8220;pitching&#8221; table and if you liked their pitch/product you voted for them by putting your poker chip in the bowl. One factor that helped keep voting fair was that each start-up had the same style board above their stand this to not jade someone view with a flashy poster.

In the end up I only managed to talk to two out of the five start-ups Inflyte and Roll TV, <a href="https://twitter.com/InflyteApp" target="_blank">Inflyte</a> is an application targeted at music promoters to send demo&#8217;s to DJ&#8217;s and other music professionals. The application allows the user to manage the music that they revive and the music that is sent to professionals this proposes a better solution to the current email based systems most record labels use.

<a href="http://www.watchroll.tv/" target="_blank">Roll TV</a> is an application that allows user to view and share music videos but also connect to external services such as tickets and merch, bridging the gap left when using YouTube for music videos.

After taking time to chat to each of the start-ups and vote for the best a number of speakers involved with the mash up, Tom Griffith was the star of the night with his blend of straight talking no nonsense advice and and his depth of the the investment industry. Tom also wins the quote of the night

> &#8220;We used to sleep on the floor of the office, when we wanted a shower we would strip down and run out out in the rain. There were number of awkward moments with the post man.&#8221;

Although there was some issues with noise from the back of the hall while talks were taking place everything we off without a hitch and really have me some points and thoughts to takeaway from the night. I can say without a doubt that Belfast needs more night like this not just for the free beer, but for the great minds all gathered in one place to help make a name for Belfast in the technology start-up world.  The winner of the night was Roll TV which gained the most votes and will move onto the next heat of the summit good luck to them and all the other start-up that attended.
