So its that time of the year again Culture Night and time to knock together a landing page for the event. I decided that it would be best to keep the same theme and colors that are used on the <a href="http://www.culturenightbelfast.com/" target="_blank">official culture night </a>site and even include the the logo for this year.

Starting off with a basic twitter bootstrap project then added some custom css classes, I also decided to use github to track the changes, I hope to add improvements and new features to the site during the next week or so for the run up to the event. I also intend to take advantage of moment js to handle the countdown as the current implementation is a very basic timmer.Related links below:
