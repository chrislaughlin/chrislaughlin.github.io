The week the register posted about a finding that BT has the ability and is using a tool that can scan a customers local network and determine what devices are connected to that network. <div>

  The new was discovered when customers revived a letter from the ISP regrading a Ethernet switch that was provided to customers, however this switch was found to be faulty and dangerous so was replaced. The letter was sent to customers who had decided that the switch was in working order and didn&#8217;t connect the replacement. BT advised the customers that they were still using the switch.

  This means that BT have the power to access your router and scan for devices connected to the local network. This may seam to be a standard tool for an ISP as they should be able to connect to your router for administration and other services work.

  My main issue with is that if you had a NAS connected to the local network BT would technically have the ability to detect this device and if not password protected explore the device causing a massive security breach.
