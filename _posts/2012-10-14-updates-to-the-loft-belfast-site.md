This week has been the come down from culture night and late night art in Belfast. Iv been concentrating my time on improving and growing the online presence of [LOFT Belfast a studio/collective/gallery][1] space in the heart of Belfast. 

The first version of the site created in late July was a word-press with a heavily customized theme to give the site a very minimal look as this suits the art sector every well. However as after some analyses of page views and their origins it was clear that 90% of users visiting the site came from Facebook, this meant that the best path of content for the LOFT group was Facebook as most users would be logged into Facebook throughout the day and would see updates more than having to come back and check the LOFT site for updates. 

This change involved removing the word-press solution from the LOFT web site and replacing it with a static page that could be a landing page that would lead users onto the Facebook and twitter. However this did remove features from the site with some time to spare I looked into adding some social and media rich features to the site. 

Mail Chip provided the news letter subscription service, taking advantage of the very reasonable free account which gives 2000 email subscriptions and allows up to 1200 emails per month. Mail chimp also handles the registration for the users, along with the mail chip subscription a php based contact form allows users to send an email directly to the LOFT email account supplying their name email and a message. 

There is still a lot of potential work for the LOFT page as it will increase in grown over the coming months and years.
