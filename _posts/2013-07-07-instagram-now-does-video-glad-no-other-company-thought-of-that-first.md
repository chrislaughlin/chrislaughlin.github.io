This post is a bit late but still just, recently instagram released an update to thier Android app. The main update seemed to the addition of video almost 6 months after vine had been released across all devices, vine had broken the norm and created a video based social network that allowed users to make short videos that can be stopped during recording this was received well by many users on twitter. What I thought the future for vine would be was for twitter to either buy them out and build this into the twitter feature set or team up together and link together very well. But instagram seen this as chance to copy the idea completely and pitch a full on fight against vine and with the user base of instagram it&#8217;s hard not to predict which platform will prevail. 

In the current social would where Facebook is dominant, users will find it hard to move to a new platform and keep their fiends and followers in the loop. It is already clear that instagram is winning the battle as I have seen very few vine shares of Facebook compared to instagram shares which look so integrated that you&#8217;ll would think this is a Facebook video. In my personal views I believe that instagram stepped the mark and acted unfair by ripping vine off and taking the lead. Only time will tell which will win the socal video battle but I predict in a year or two people will not know the the name vine.
