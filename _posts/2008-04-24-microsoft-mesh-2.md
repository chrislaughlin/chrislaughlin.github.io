  Recently Microsoft have started to release parts of there mesh. The Microsoft mesh is the latest thing that has been released by the people at windows live. If combines different section for user too have access to files and information where ever they are in the world. The different parts of the mesh are the sky drive and folder share. The sky drive is a new system for windows live, hotmail and MSN users to back up and store file in an online hard drive. This system works almost like web space. Where the user can upload files and access them anywhere that they have a internet connection. Unlike most types of web space the sky drive does not use any software for uploading or downloading the files. This means that it may be slower depending on the network traffic. However the plus side of this, is that the user will not need to have the access rights that are needed to use FTP connection as many public networks have theses connections blocked.

  The folder share is almost like a remote connection. However you do not get access the to the computer GUI. This part of the mess requires software to be installed on the host computer. The computer that you need to remote connect to has the folder share software installed on it. When you want to access the files and folders you simply sign into the folder share web site. And choose the computer that you want to connect to (which has to be turned on and connected at its end) they then the user will be able to access the files and folders stored on the computer.

  This sounds to be a big break through in the file sharing community. The only worry is that with the ever growing amount of people being hacked by key loggers the danger is that some one could get your password and take control of all the file and folders that you use with the live mesh.
