Well its my first non-tech blog post in a log time but, though I would do a post on my recent start of a coffee subscription. I have been drinking &#8220;fresh&#8221; ground coffee for a number of years and have tried many different brands and blends. Coffee subscriptions have caught my eye a few times but every subscription I had seen sent the roasted beans only, as a non grinder owner (*this will soon change*) I was put off.

Until I had seen a tweet with a offer code for <a href="http://www.pactcoffee.com" target="_blank">Pact Coffee</a> that would get you the first delivery for <a href="http://www.pactcoffee.com/signup/introduce?voucher=beanblog" target="_blank">£1</a>, how could I resist a saving. The process of signing up and ordering was very smooth and simple, I like the fact that all my coffee needs were addressed. Asking how often I drink, what my main brewing method, do I grind etc. All this then lead to my selection of coffee for my first batch which was <a href="https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/31" target="_blank">Fazenda Lagoa</a> described to have a brown sugar taste with a lemon acidity.

Once I had filled in all my details and my coffee was selected I was told the dispatch date and that the coffee will be sent first class. Not long after this, I think it was the same day I got an email saying that the coffee was dispatched. Now for the over the top of customer service, later that day I got a call from Pact Coffee I thought that something was wrong with my order, however the call was to thank me for joining the service and that my coffee was on its way (*to be honest I was going to leave after the first £1 batch but this kept me interested*). I think this personal touch was great and such a nice way to deal with customers in the current world of &#8220;no-reply&#8221; emails. So then I waited unfortunately I gave my office address for the delivery and the package was to be delivered on a Saturday which is a no post day for the office.  Monday came and I received the package, which was packaged so that it was letter box friendly, next time ill change my address to home as I only drink my aeropress at home.

The coffee had a nice aroma and was ground finer that I normally get I can only assume that this was due to my areopress selection. My first press followed my standard brewing method using the inverted aeropress, this gave a nice taste and strong flavour I must admit I couldn&#8217;t taste the brown sugar, however after years of drinking strong black instant and lots of cheap beer my taste is not what it used to be. The acid was not too strong which I really liked as some store bought ground can be really bitter and give me heart burn however the Fazenda Lagoa was smooth and left a nice after taste. Not long after starting to drink the brew I got an email from Pact Coffee listing some different brewing guides, Iv been using the areopress for almost a year and can&#8217;t think of how to brew differently. But I still decided to give the <a href="http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/08/aeropress-brewing-guide/" target="_blank">guide</a> a read the method was slightly different than mine, they suggested only filling the water up until the number 2 on the press where as I normally fill it to the top and then top the coffee up with hot water. Almost as if the press was giving you a shot like you would from an espresso machine.

Once I tired this method I could see a world of difference the coffee was not as strong and over powering as it was before and had a more smoother taste. The only issues have noticed from the coffee compared to other blends I have tried is when removing the puck from the press I notice a lot more water dripping than I would see from my normal less coarse grinds. I&#8217;m not sure if this is related to the grind of the coffee or the different press method of using less water to coffee. However this does not affect the taste and still makes for a really enjoyable coffee. I would really recommend Pact as from what I can tell they are a start up company quickly expanding, have a good approach to customers and coffee, without getting to technical and &#8216;hipster&#8217; which makes me feel comfortable using their service.  I can&#8217;t wait for my next coffee and will be using the service for a long time. Keep up the good work guys, below are some photos of my most recent coffee experience.
